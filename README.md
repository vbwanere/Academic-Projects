## Daisy Chain Chip Fabrication \& Die Attach on Flexible Substrates
This study addresses the need for low-temperature die attach methods suitable for flexible substrates like Kapton and paper, commonly used in printed electronics. It investigates wire bonding and flip chip bonding techniques to attach a bare silicon MEMS resonator to a soil moisture sensor. Wire bonding was performed using ultrasonic wedge bonding, while flip chip bonding employed solderless adhesives to meet temperature-sensitive requirements. The results showed successful mechanical attachment with epoxy and electrical connections via silver epoxy, although challenges like low hardness of screen-printed silver metallization limited wire bonding effectiveness. The findings underscore the potential of alternative bonding techniques for temperature-sensitive and flexible electronics, highlighting the need for improved substrate preparation to enhance bonding reliability.


## CFR 3D Printing of Onyx-Based Composites
This study aimed to explore the impact of carbon fiber (CF) orientation on the tensile properties of Onyx-based composite materials to understand how fiber alignment affects mechanical performance. Specimens were 3D printed using the Continuous Fiber Reinforcement (CFR) process with CF orientations of 0°, 15°, 30°, and 45°, and tensile tests were performed following ASTM D638-14 standards. The results showed that tensile strength, peak load, and modulus were highest for fibers oriented at 0° to the load direction, while the Onyx-only material exhibited the lowest values and highest plasticity. The findings highlight the significance of fiber alignment in enhancing tensile strength, demonstrating that CF reinforcement improves strength but reduces plasticity, making the material more brittle. This has implications for optimizing material design in applications requiring tailored mechanical properties.


## Mini AMR
The autonomous robot project aimed to demonstrate advanced navigation and interaction capabilities through wall following, beacon tracking, and police car pushing tasks. The team developed a two-tiered robot using IR-retroreflective sensors, IR photodiode with potentiometers, and a Vive tracking system, powered by a dual system (power bank for ESP32, 9V batteries for motors) with completely soldered circuits for robustness. Implementation involved an ESP32-S2 Wrover microprocessor controlling a two-wheel drive system with TT motors, sophisticated software algorithms, neutral steering, and adaptive behaviors like auto-reverse when stuck. The robot performed excellently across all tasks: achieving smooth wall following with seamless obstacle avoidance, successfully detecting both beacon frequencies (23Hz and 550Hz), and effectively completing the police car pushing task. Ultimately, the project proved that thoughtful engineering focused on simplicity could outperform more complex solutions, as demonstrated by the team's innovative use of IR-retroreflective sensors and potentiometers instead of traditional components, yielding superior results while maintaining simplicity and reliability.


## Solar Panel Deployment Mechanism
The project addressed the power supply challenge in solar sailing satellites, where traditional wall-mounted solar cells become inefficient due to the large solar sail blocking sunlight. The team developed deployable solar panels for COEPSAT-2, a nanosatellite with a 40-square-meter solar sail, featuring four panels with nine solar cells each, initially stowed using nylon wire to meet launch vehicle space constraints. The mechanism employed an outside-stop hinge with a 180-degree torsion spring (1.5 N-mm/degree stiffness), operating in three stages: release, deployment, and locking, where a nylon nichrome mechanism triggers deployment, and a carbon fiber flat spring with cam follower mechanism ensures secure locking post-deployment. Through analytical calculations, structural simulations, and successful horizontal testing to minimize gravity effects, the team validated an effective, low-power-consuming solar panel deployment and locking mechanism, advancing power generation capabilities for solar sailing nanosatellites while maintaining reliability and efficiency in space operations.

## Design of a MEMS Gyroscope
This paper presents the design of a vibratory MEMS gyroscope optimized for low output current and bandwidth, achieving 0.1 nA/degree/sec sensitivity and 50 Hz bandwidth. The gyroscope, fabricated using Silicon on Glass (SiOG) technology, utilizes a parallel-plate differential transduction mechanism and a comb-drive system to maximize displacement and improve sensitivity. The design process involved detailed calculations and considerations of fabrication constraints, leading to the final structure with a Q-factor of 100 and a drive voltage of 45 V. The results demonstrate the device's capability to measure angular velocities within a range of 0.166 rpm to 913 rpm, with minimal current requirements. The study highlights the challenges of balancing performance and fabrication limitations and provides a foundation for future research on noise mitigation and electrostatic tuning to further enhance gyroscope accuracy. This study explores the folded spring system in MEMS gyroscopes, which is critical for accurate angular velocity sensing, to enhance the understanding of its mechanical behavior and reliability. Using COMSOL Multiphysics®, the study analyzed stress distribution, displacement profiles, and eigenfrequencies through finite element simulations. Results showed maximum displacement of 4.38E-9 m and a fundamental frequency of 9549 Hz, closely matching theoretical values with errors under 6.2\%. This confirms the validity of the numerical model and emphasizes the importance of precise folded spring design for reliable gyroscope performance.
