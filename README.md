## Daisy Chain Chip Fabrication \& Die Attach on Flexible Substrates
This study addresses the need for low-temperature die attach methods suitable for flexible substrates like Kapton and paper, commonly used in printed electronics. It investigates wire bonding and flip chip bonding techniques to attach a bare silicon MEMS resonator to a soil moisture sensor. The findings underscore the potential of alternative bonding techniques for temperature-sensitive and flexible electronics, highlighting the need for improved substrate preparation to enhance bonding reliability.


## CFR 3D Printing of Onyx-Based Composites
Investigated the impact of carbon fiber (CF) orientation on the tensile properties of Onyx-based composite materials to understand how fiber alignment affects mechanical performance. Specimens were 3D printed using the Continuous Fiber Reinforcement (CFR) process with CF orientations of 0°, 15°, 30°, and 45°, and tensile tests were performed following ASTM D638-14 standards. The findings highlight the significance of fiber alignment in enhancing tensile strength, demonstrating that CF reinforcement improves strength but reduces plasticity, making the material more brittle. This has implications for optimizing material design in applications requiring tailored mechanical properties.


## Mini AMR
The team developed a two-tiered robot using IR-retroreflective sensors, IR photodiode with potentiometers, and a Vive tracking system, powered by a dual system (power bank for ESP32, 9V batteries for motors) with completely soldered circuits for robustness. Implementation involved an **ESP32-S2 Wrover** microprocessor controlling a two-wheel drive system with TT motors, neutral steering, and adaptive behaviors like auto-reverse when stuck. The robot performed excellently across all tasks: achieving smooth wall following with seamless obstacle avoidance.


## Solar Panel Deployment Mechanism
The project addressed the power supply challenge in solar sailing satellites, where traditional wall-mounted solar cells become inefficient due to the large solar sail blocking sunlight. The team developed deployable solar panels for COEPSAT-2, a nanosatellite with a 40-square-meter solar sail, featuring four panels with nine solar cells each, initially stowed using nylon wire to meet launch vehicle space constraints. Nylon nichrome mechanism triggers deployment, and a carbon fiber flat spring with cam follower mechanism ensures secure locking post-deployment.

## Design of a MEMS Gyroscope
This paper presents the design of a vibratory MEMS gyroscope optimized for low output current and bandwidth, achieving 0.1 nA/degree/sec sensitivity and 50 Hz bandwidth. The gyroscope utilizes a parallel-plate differential transduction mechanism and a comb-drive system to maximize displacement and improve sensitivity. Using COMSOL Multiphysics®, the study analyzed stress distribution, displacement profiles, and eigenfrequencies through finite element simulations. Results showed maximum displacement of 4.38E-9 m and a fundamental frequency of 9549 Hz, closely matching theoretical values with errors under 6.2\%.
