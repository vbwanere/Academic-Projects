 * Link Bit
 *
 * A setting of 1 in the link bit with both the activity and inactivity 
 * functions enabled delays the start of the activity function until inactivity 
 * is detected. After activity is detected, inactivity detection begins, 
 * preventing the detection of activity. This bit serially links the activity 
 * and inactivity functions. When this bit is set to 0, the inactivity and 
 * activity functions are concurrent. Additional information can be found in the
 * Link Mode section.
 *
 * When clearing the link bit, it is recommended that the part be placed into 
 * standby mode and then set back to measurement mode with a subsequent write. 
 * This is done to ensure that the device is properly biased if sleep mode is 
 * manually disabled; otherwise, the first few samples of data after the link 
 * bit is cleared may have additional noise, especially if the device was asleep 
 * when the bit was cleared.
 *
 * AUTO_SLEEP Bit
 *
 * If the link bit is set, a setting of 1 in the AUTO_SLEEP bit sets the ADXL345
 * to switch to sleep mode when inactivity is detected (that is, when 
 * acceleration has been below the THRESH_INACT value for at least the time 
 * indicated by TIME_INACT). A setting of 0 disables automatic switching 
 * to sleep mode. See the description of the sleep bit in this section for more 
 * information.
 *
 * When clearing the AUTO_SLEEP bit, it is recommended that the part be placed 
 * into standby mode and then set back to measurement mode with a subsequent 
 * write. This is done to ensure that the device is properly biased if sleep 
 * mode is manually disabled; otherwise, the first few samples of data after the
 * AUTO_SLEEP bit is cleared may have additional noise, especially if the device
 * was asleep when the bit was cleared.
 *
 * Measure Bit
 *
 * A setting of 0 in the measure bit places the part into standby mode, and a 
 * setting of 1 places the part into measurement mode. The ADXL345 powers up in 
 * standby mode with minimum power consumption.
 *
 * Sleep Bit
 *
 * A setting of 0 in the sleep bit puts the part into the normal mode of 
 * operation, and a setting of 1 places the part into sleep mode. Sleep mode 
 * suppresses DATA_READY, stops transmission of data to FIFO, and switches the 
 * sampling rate to one specified by the wakeup bits. In sleep mode, only the 
 * activity function can be used.
 *
 * When clearing the sleep bit, it is recommended that the part be placed into
